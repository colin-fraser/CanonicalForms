Description: Easily specify a "Canonical Form" for a dataset. A CanonicalForm
  object is a simple and lightweight container for properties and data validation checks
  that can be applied to a dataset. This package is designed to be minimally invasive to
  existing workflows, so that data validation checks can be applied with just one or two
  simple function calls that fit seamlessly with existing data processing steps.
